# Arrow

Arrow is an architecture-agnostic, direct-to-random stimuli generator designed for architectural and micro-architectural contexts. 
It generates diverse stimuli, workloads and scenarios to evaluate and stress-test a wide range of architectures, enabling comprehensive analysis and optimization of system performance. 
With its flexible design, Arrow is ideal for researchers and engineers assessing architectural decisions across various environments.

## Features

- Architecture-agnostic design: Not tied to any specific hardware or architecture.
- Generate random assembly stimuli for architectural and micro-architectural analysis.
- Evaluate system performance under diverse workloads and edge cases.
- Extensible library for adding custom workflows, stimuli, and use cases.
- Supports input/output operations for automated validation pipelines.
- Easily integrates with front-end frameworks like Streamlit.
- Built with flexibility for confidential internal usage.
- Full direct to random spectrum: from targeted corner cases to fully random, large-scale scenarios for comprehensive feature coverage.

## Future Intentions

While Arrow is currently open-source under the GPL-3.0, I plan to explore monetization options in the future, including:
- Offering premium features or services.
- Providing enterprise licensing for specific use cases.
- Selling commercial licenses for organizations requiring proprietary extensions.

The current open-source version and its license will remain unaffected. Future versions or components may be released under different terms.
